# CAR CHARGING STATION
This project is a simulation of a car charging station that utilizes several alternative sources of energy. It aims to provide a realistic model of car charging stations, taking into account factors such as multiple locations, charging time, car waiting time, and weather conditions. The simulation includes a weather condition component that logs the situation at the charging station. It enables the switching between alternative energy sources based on the simulated weather conditions.
To demonstrate our simulation we have two methods. One is through an interactive way in which the user must register and book a slot after which they can have access to the charging station.
Another way to demonstrate simulatenous charging of multiple cars across different charging station, we have created a fixed pool of around 20 cars.

## Task Breakdown
### Hometask1:
- Krithika: Worked on introducing multiple exception handling by adding two catch blocks for Array Index out of bounds and for a custom exception.
- Akhilesh: Worked on rethrowing exceptions for Class not defined.
- Akhil: Worked on resource management using try with resources and finally statements.
- Vipin: Worked on chaining exceptions by adding exceptions for Insufficient energy in the charging station which throws ChargeError.

### Hometask2:
- Krithika: Worked on multi user access to charging station.This is done by introducing the timeslot manager.
- Akhilesh: Worked on managing log files, creating, moving, adding timestamp information in the files.
- Akhil: Worked on adding character stream and data stream
- Vipin: Worked on creating meta data.

### Hometask3:
- Krithika: Worked on the Producer Consumer concept and the shared resource creation between the producer and the consumer.
- Akhilesh: Worked on implementing the charging of the cars during slots availability and handling multiple threads for simultaneous charging of the cars.
- Akhil N: Worked on the charging of the energy reserve in the charging station using multiple threads.
- Vipin K: Worked on implementing the wait condition in case there is no slot availability in the charging station.

### Hometask4:
- Krithika: Worked on creating the regex pattern to get input from the user and match against the file name
- Akhilesh: Worked on creating the Energy switching between various sources such as SOLAR,WIND,GRID based on the weather condition
- Akhil: Worked on creating the logging class for logging the events in the charging station and energy management system
- Vipin: Worked on integrating the changes into the main branch and improvising the TimeslotManager class for creating a new priority based array list.

### Hometask5:
- Krithika: Worked on UnitTesting of Username and SharedResource classes.
- Akhilesh: Worked on UnitTesting of Car and TimeSlotManager classes.
- Akhil: Worked on UnitTesting of  Logging class.
- Vipin: Worked on UnitTesting of EnergyManagementSystem Class.
